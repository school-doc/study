Question 0:  (in computing, we often start counting from 0 ...)  

(a) Convert (321.23)8  into its base-2 representation.

(b) Convert (57.6875)10 into its base-3 representation with 4 digit precision after the . point.

(c) Convert (272)10 into its base-8 representation. 

(d) Convert (1100000011001010)2 into is base-16 representation.

(e) Convert (0. C 0 C A)16 into is base-10 representation.

(f) Convert (0.10)10 into its base-2 representation using 12 digits of precision after the binary point. 

Question 1:  
(a)  Consider the following binary number :

     01011110 

What decimal value do these 1s and 0s represent if we interpret these bits to represent:

(i) an unsigned  8-bit binary integer?
(ii) an 8-bit two's complement integer?
(iii) an integer number represented in 8-bit sign-magnitude notation?

(b)  Perform the operation:

            (-15)
       +    (+ 1)
     =       -14 

using 5-bit twos complement arithmetic.  Indicate whether overflow has occurred.

(c)  Perform the operation:

            (-15)
       +    (+ 1)
     =       -14 

using 5-bit sign magnitude arithmetic.  Indicate whether overflow has occurred.

(d) Perform the operation:

             -16
       x   (- 1)
       =    +16

using 5-bit two's complement multiplication following the "pencil-paper" method using
sign extension.

(e)  Perform the operation:

            (+4)
          - (+6)
          =  -2

in 5-bit two's complement arithmetic. 


Question 2:

(a) Consider the following floating point format:  S EE  MMM  where:

S = sign bit
EE = two bit exponent stored in excess-2 notation
MMM = 3 bit mantissa stored in normalized form. 

There is no hidden `1' bit in the mantisaa and the base is 4. 

(i) State whether each of the following mantissas is normalized or not:

001

010

011

100

(ii) Give the decimal value of the smallest positive number which can be represented in this format.

(iii) Express the decimal number +3.5 in this format .

(b) Give the value as a real decimal number the value represented by the IEEE 754 32-bit floating point number 40200000 (this is the 8 digit hexadecimal representation of the IEEE 754 number). 

Hint:  Use the shortcut method to convert this hex number into its equivalent 32 binary bits.
