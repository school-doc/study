Practice Problems 2

Question 1.

Given a binary pattern in some memory location, it it possible to tell whether this pattern represents a machine instruction or a number?

Question 2.

Write an asembly language program that can evaluate the expression:

(A x B) + (C x D)           (A,B, C, D refer to main memory addresses)

in a single accumulator processor. Assume the processor is a single address machine  and has LOAD, STORE, MULTIPLY, and ADD instructions. For example, the following are typical
forms of the use of these instructions:

LOAD some_address
MULTIPLY some_other_address
STORE yet_another_address
LOAD another_address
MULTIPLY address_x
ADD some_address
STORE address_xyz


Question 3.

Registers R1 and R2 of a computer contain the decimal values 1200 and 4600. What is the effective address of the memory operand in each of the following instructions?

(i) MOVE 20(R1), R5
(ii) LOAD #3000, R5
(iii) STORE R5, 30(R1,R2)
(iv) ADD -(R2), R5
(v) SUBTRACT (R1)+, R5


Note:  the convention for the above instructions is:  opcode  source1  ,  source2/destination


Question 4:

Register R5 in a program is used to point to the top of the stack.  Write a sequence of instructions using indexed, autoincrement,   and autodecrement  addressing modes to perform each of the following tasks (DO NOT USE PUSH OR POP INSTRUCTIONS) :

(a) Pop the top two items from the stack, add them, and then push the result onto the stack.
(b) Copy the fifth item from the top of the stack into register R3.
